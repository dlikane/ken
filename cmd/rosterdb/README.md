Iâ€™ve developed the attached sql to identify where worked (timesheet) hours <> Billed hours.  Output sample below.
The first Almira actually matches because her single timesheet (clock on/off) covers two shifts 2.5 + 3 = 5.5 timesheet hours.
Could you fix the sql to not report timesheets that match multiple shifts please?

1. It's good you use aliases for tables, but please use them for all fields in query, otherwise I can only guess which field belongs to each table.
I guess
SELECT DISTINCT
    e.roster_employee_id,
    p.roster_position_name,
    e.roster_employee_name,
etc.

2. I don't understand why you use:
        AND MONTH(roster_shift_start) >= 12
        AND MONTH(roster_shift_start) <= 12
    isn't it the same as
        AND MONTH(roster_shift_start) = 12

3. Your origianla question. Presume you have a temporary table or query:
        emp_id, start_ts, end_ts, shift_id
    you are interested to find entry where exists start_ts or end_ts is between start_ts/end_ts for the same emp_id

        SELECT t1.emp_id, t1.shift_id
        FROM tmp t1
        WHERE EXISTS(
            SELECT 1 from tmp t2
            WHERE t1.emp_id = t2.emp_id
            AND t1.shift_id <> t2.shift_id
            AND (
                t1.start_ts > t2.start_ts AND t1.start_ts < t2.end_ts
                OR t1.end_ts > t2.start_ts AND t1.end_ts < t2.end_ts
