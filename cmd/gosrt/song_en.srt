1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I would give away my hearing

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
To stay in dad's hands

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Tell me how to live on scorched earth

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
When our closest are speared

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
When soldiers are buried as stray dogs

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
When for truth one gets impaled

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
When a best friend kicks down your do or

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And now has the prefix 'ex'

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
When eyes are corroded with poison

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
When there is no point

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
In going back

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Don't come back, you don't belong

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
A home is where the creek flows

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And where you are welcomed

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
There is no point in going back

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Don't come back, the entrance is closed

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
A home is where you meet the sunrise

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And where you are welcomed

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Father, you can see from there

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
How poor are getting poorer

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Bunkers are built as wolf lairs

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
How bloggers are getting louder

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
How they swear, led to execution block

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
How brother fights brother, rattled with fear

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
How mothers moan, the sick without hospitals

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
How we "traitors", yell from overseas

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The eyes destroyed with deadly poison

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Back, back...

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Don't come back

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You don't belong

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
A home is where the creek sings

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And where you bring joy

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
There is no point in going back

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Don't come back, the entrance is closed

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Home is where you meet the sunrise

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And where you are welcome

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
In going back

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Don't come back

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You don't belong

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
A home is where the creek flows

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And where you are welcomed

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
There is no point in going back

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
There is no point in going back

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You don't belong
