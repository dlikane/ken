1
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
How did I get started?

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Once upon a time there was a girl called Tanya

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and at some moment, something there: something like a pea, which is bothering me.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I don’t like it, I don’t.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Anyways, I became anxious, nothing seemed to bother me, everything was fine.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I was really happy, everything was good, I was healthy and doing physical exercise.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I was pretty sure I didn’t have any symptoms, nothing was wrong.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I came to my GP and subconsciously, I didn’t think

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
that it would be cancer or anything like that.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I thought, the GP will do the checkup and will say - everything is fine, go home.
